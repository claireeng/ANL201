## Implications of COVID-19 on e-Commerce – Costco Analysis

## Introduction
The presence of COVID-19 had accelerated the adoption of online purchase. Alongside the convenience of e-commerce, online shopping is expected to pervade in a post COVID-19 world. According to Mckinsey, more than 50% of grocery customers who started online shopping in response to COVID-19 intend to continue using the online platform in the future (Günday et al., 2020).

This research focuses on Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco”), a retail enterprise selling affordable general merchandises such as Food and Sundries, Hardlines, Fresh Foods, Softlines and Ancillary, with over 803 physical stores across the world (Costco, 2020). Its competitors include wholesalers and retailers such as Walmart, Target, Kroger, Amazon, and more.

**Insight #1: Movement restrictions saw increased e-commerce sales**

A rise in the number of COVID-19 cases from 2019 to 2021 had led to lesser movement within the community. Other possible reasons for decreased traffic could be due to the nation’s lockdown measures, social distancing for fear of disease spread, stay-at-home orders or mandatory closures.

Likewise, Costco saw an increase on its e-commerce sales. As people are refrained from leaving their houses, necessities and groceries are done at the comfort of their homes. Customers order online to get items delivered to their doorsteps.

**Insight #2: Costco is unprepared to handle the sudden surge in demand of e-commerce**

Overall, Costco experienced decreased productivity, evident by a slower growth rate in profit per employee, slower delivery of products to its customers, and lower efficiency in warehouse utilisation.

Prior to COVID-19, Costco’s business model involves a high dependency on its brick-and-mortar stores. Its competitive advantage is part of providing customers the physical presence of a store, to allow their customers to enjoy the experience of “Treasure Hunting” (Wall Street Journal, 2021). Several high-end products at low prices are randomly placed around the warehouse to provide a fun experience where customers can unexpectedly discover valuable items while shopping. 

With Costco’s strong focus on its brick-and-mortar stores, its e-commerce business could have taken a back seat, potentially explaining Costco’s diminished ability to manage its sudden rise in e-commerce sales.

**Insight #3: Membership constitutes a large part of Costco’s income**

Costco has a strong loyal membership base, as seen by a steady increase of membership revenue in 2020. Potentially, Costco’s ability to pass on savings to its customers remains as its strong value proposition, resulting in a high renewal membership.

On the other hand, customer satisfaction fell in 2020. A potential reason could be the lack of development of its e-commerce platform even though there is increasing customer preference for online shopping.
